# test_fmt
A place to test what data formats are supported.
## Purpose
In a comparison of servers for sharing files among team members, Google Drive falls down in at least two respects:
 
 - It requires creating a Google account, which requires the user to supply private information;
 - Even then, it limits the filetypes that it will display. Any for which it doesn't already have a handler would need to be downloaded to use the member's own platform viewer, or else select an online App from a list that Google offers, all of which require total update/delete access to all files in the Drive. Yeah, right.
 
OneDrive provides somewhat better handling of some text filetypes that it recognises, eg .java and .html. It also properly displays PDFs and OpenDocument files, as well as MS-Office formats of course.

This repository will allow any team member to try viewing various formats.
